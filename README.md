# Spot Me 

This repo contains all the source code for the Spot Me project.

It was a hackathon project for OneWeek2017, and was developed in 3 days so a lot of the content is left unfinished.

Please install the Microsoft Kinect SDK before using the repo.

This project was made with the help of Accord.net's machine learning framework.

# Please Note that this piece of code is in a DEMO mode!

This means that when you run it, it will work just like the demo that we conducted at OneWeek. Some stuff is therefore hardcoded in. 

To add new exercises, click on back to exercise list and then click onto exercise manager and add exercises through that screen.
The demo will only load Workout A **this is hardcoded in for the demo**, so to change this workout go and edit the .txt file of Workout A (and make sure to update the count of number of exercises which is near the top)
